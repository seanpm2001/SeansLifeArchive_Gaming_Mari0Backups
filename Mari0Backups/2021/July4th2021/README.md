## Mari0 map-pack

The Internet went out today, and I ran out of productive things I was willing to do offline, so I gave myself time to play mari0. I didn't bother backing up my previous data onto my current laptop, which got a system reinstall in May 2021. I decided to start from scratch.

This map-pack is very incomplete compared to my last one, but I intend to make this a better map-pack that plays better and functions better. This map-pack currently only has 1 level (1-1) and is very incomplete, as I was only able to play for about 25 minutes before I noticed the Internet came back, and I went back to my normal activities.

Enjoy the map-pack, it is going to get more advanced than this. - [Seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)
