## Mari0 map-pack

I worked on the new map-pack a little further today during a break period, as I had an urge to play. I made minor progress, but I stopped, as I didn't have much time to play.I only played for about 29 minutes today.

I added support for levels 1-3. I put some work into it, but it still looks kind of crappy I intend to put some sort of unique bossfight at the end of world 8-4, maybe someone can make a texture pack for the game that replaces bowser with Wheatley or GLaDOS.
