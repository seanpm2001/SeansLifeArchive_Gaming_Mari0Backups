## Mari0 map-pack

I worked on the new map-pack a little further today during a break period, and I made some progress, but I stopped, as I began producing low quality edits. I will fix these later. I also found that everything I did for level 1-1 can be bypassed without the use of a portal gun, something I originally thought I fixed.

I added support for levels 1-2, 1-4, 3-1, and 8-4. I intend to put some sort of unique bossfight at the end of world 8-4, maybe someone can make a texture pack for the game that replaces bowser with Wheatley or GLaDOS.
